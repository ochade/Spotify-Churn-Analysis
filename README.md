A side-by-side comparison of Descriptive Analytics (Power BI) and Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression) to diagnose and predict subscriber churn for Spotify.

Project Overview
This project is a practical exploration of the "Side A vs. Side B" debate in data strategy: when is a dashboard enough, and when does a business actually need Machine Learning?.

Using a Spotify listener dataset, I developed a dual-layered solution to address user retention:

Side A (The Dashboard): A high-fidelity Power BI executive view for real-time monitoring of churn rates and listener engagement.

Side B (The ML Model): A focused Logistic Regression model designed not just to predict who will leave, but to diagnose why they are leaving.

The goal of this project was to prove that as a Data Scientist and Product Leader, the objective isn't to build the most complex model possible, but to solve the problem with the lowest complexity and highest actionable impact.

The Problem: "How can Spotify use listener data to prevent churn?"
In the hyper-competitive entertainment tech space, losing a subscriber isn't just a loss of monthly revenue; it's a loss of data and long-term Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

This project addresses three critical business questions:

Visibility: Can we identify at-risk revenue at a glance? (Solved via the 0.19 Churn Rate alert on the dashboard).

Diagnosis: What specific behaviors—like high support tickets or low daily usage—signal that a user is about to quit?.

Action: How can we move "Free" users into "Premium" loyalty loops based on their unique engagement patterns?.

By aligning Product Operations with Machine Learning, this analysis provides a roadmap for reducing churn through targeted interventions rather than generic marketing.
